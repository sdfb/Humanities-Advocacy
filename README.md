NEH+Grants+API.py is a Python script that queries the NEH API and downloads all recent NEH grants in a designated state or congressional district.  Useful for concrete examples of NEH impact in specific communities.  

PA HUD18 Tweets.ipynb is Jupyter Notebook that takes in a CSV of Congressional delagates' Twitter handles and template talking points, and returns Tweet texts targeting or thanking each member of Congress.
